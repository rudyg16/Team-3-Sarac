in the tie.

you?
>> Yeah.
>> Yes. He didn't know anything about it,
but when it hits his arm, his arm is
away from his body, it stops the
athletic player getting to it.
>> He's going to be in a bit of trouble
here.

He mis times his jump. That's what it
was all about. He sticks his arm out.

it's Atletico Madrid won inside 8
minutes.
>> Yeah, I think Minion was hoping he'd go
down the middle.
>> So just didn't make a dive but it's a
very good penalty league game for
Atletic this season. Alvarez.
>> Oh, he's done him with the eyes, has he?
>> Well, anyway, Minion was rooted
discombobulated perhaps.
Good penalty.
One nil to Atleti
who in years gone by. His 105th European
game tonight. Dearon born in France.
Qualifies for Sagal. Decent run by him.
It's a good chance that came to Yiddika.
No finish to the goalkeeper. Say he's
touched the ball with his right arm
which was in a natural position and away
from the body.
That's a decentish effort from
Trristaldi. Simeone saying throw the
ball down the line. It's thrown into
young Simeone who gives it away. Tries
to bend into the far corner as you can
see from the flight of the ball. Doesn't
get any whip on it whatsoever. Long way
wide in the end.
Save Rain getting heavier. Clear to the
back by Hanko.
And Sav's on to it again. Marginal 21
international. It's not a good clearance
and hit by Jaldi. Decent save down to
his left.
>> This is the chance. Jente gave the ball
away. He hit Vanakan in the face almost.
It's a really good effort all the way
back there which is at the moment.
Got a chance here to pull the cross back
into the middle from Sab. It's an

GOAL I THINK. TWO-0 TO ATHLETIC ON THE
STROKE OF HALIME. OH, that's a real blow
for Bugger. Wasn't over the line. You
see Lukeman just pulling away here.
>> That's Lukeman's goal, isn't it?
>> As long as he's on side. Looked as
though he was on side when the ball was
headed. He might actually be level with
the ball, but it comes off his right
knee
just here.
It's going to be a tight one.

Let's have a look from this angle.
I think Koke was just
keeping him on side. Not Koke, it's
Henko number 17.
It's going to be a tight call though.
If it is allowed, they're back in the
game here. Club Buga

the second half here. Here's the switch
of play.
>> Sardi works the defender, starts to go
back, realizes where it's going to go,
then just gets into that near post
space. Brilliant.
>> Broke in by Chasaldi for his 12th of the
season
and his third in this competition. He
had a hand in the first goal. Two goals
in eight minutes, but it's two a piece.
Simeone ended up being the right back.
Molina was tucked in field. Simeone
couldn't cope with the pace of Dieon who
I think's been their most dangerous
player.
>> And it continues the run now.
Koke looking for Sor. Big chance for the
substitute
in the frame of the goal. Well, that's
what he can do. Great ball from Koke.
>> Just gets off the back of his marker.
It's a very good attempt.
>> That could be expensive. Alvarez Bayerna
Sorlock from the angle draws the
goalkeeper. Strong arm by Minion.
Certainly been bright since he came on.
Sorlock
and it's Bayern.
Strong ending by Atletic. 12 to go.
Jurente early ball in. Sort of a tactic
and scores.
And Odonz switched off and it might have
gone in off him.
Well, that's a good ball played out
wide. There's the run from Urente. Plays
it into a good area and he's trying to
play it out for a corner and he passes
it into his own net for Donz.
I think he's looked nervy the whole of
the evening. He knows that Sorot is
coming. You can see he's opened up his
foot to play it off for a corner and he
gets it all wrong. Johnny Cardoso is one
of the substitutes who's getting ready
to come on for Atléico defensive
midfield player. Solis with the run off

on Yudika opportunity perhaps here for
Solis. They've done it again. Or have
they?
Or have they? The arm goes up. The flag
goes up.
>> Does he make his run a fraction too
early? Fullback high up.
>> Oh, that's tight. Very tight. Look at
the line of cut grass.
>> Yeah.
>> Very, very tight this.
>> It's a good finish. really good finish.
I think it was Molina that was the
closest player to playing him on side.
>> Well, that's Molina's last contribution
to the game.
>> It's a goal.
>> It's a goal and it's 3-3.
>> What a fantastic game we've seen.
>> He's in the mix. All up to the near
post. That's a good header away.
And the referee calls it a day.
Bugger three, Atletico Madrid three. A
topsyturvy tie.
