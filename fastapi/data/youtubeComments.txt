oXllA7juRNE: @Raptorman0909: like_count: 12 The Gunners looked in control through the first half with ease and looked to be cruising in the second until....   That first goal by Wolves was terrific and it really seemed to elevate them and Arsenal didn't respond to that fast enough.  I like Trosard, but overplaying the hit turned out to be a bad idea!  Wolves second goal was almost as impressive as their first.  They look to be going down, but they might just do that kicking and screaming!  Proud of the resilience in the second!
oXllA7juRNE: @maxwell2722: like_count: 10 Trossard staying down after realizing it was bueno trying to help him up is such clown behavior. Playing scared like that against wolves is why Arsenal don’t have it in them again. Letting Wolves have a better mentality down a goal with 5 minutes left is embarassing
